This is the public-facing repository for my company, JL Analytics, which provides services for online custom manufacturing.

## What is JL Analytics?

JL Analytics was my company that I started during my senior year of high school to address a need I saw in online custom manufacturing, and also as a way for me to gain practical real-world work experience. Running the company has given me a broad perspective on a multitude of topics outside the technical space of programming and modeling.

## What do I do?

I leveraged Python and Selenium to extract hard-to-gather pricing data, which was then used for modeling to inform upper-level decision-making. This has given me exposure to using data to drive decision-making and demonstrated how powerful of a tool that can be.
